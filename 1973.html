   <p> The 1973 World Series was the second of 5 that the New York Mets have reached over
       the course of their exhistence. Despite being tied 3 games to 3 going into the 7th game,
	   the Mets ended up dropping the last game 2-5. The series was very back-and-forth, as the teams
	   alternated wins going up to the 5th game, where the Mets actually led the series 3-2. 
	   However, in a pitching duel in game 6, the momentum shifted, which ultimately led to the 
	   A's winning the last two games of the series. </p>
