 <p> The 2015 World Series was a very exciting appearance for Mets fans. The Mets had been in
 quite the dry spell for the last several years, and they seemingly came out of nowhere in
 2015. Led by a team of younger players, the Mets swept the powerhouse Cubs in the National
 League Championship Series, whereas the Royals seemed to have much more trouble in their
 League Championship Series. The Mets seemed to have all of the momentum, yet they found
 themselves down 2 games to none early on. However, they convincingly won game 3 and looked
 poised to bounce back in the latter haf of the series. However, they were truely outmatched
 as the Royals had seemingly no problem with them at all in games 4 and 5. This was another
 disappointing series for the Mets, as they looked like the best team in the postseason leading
 up to the World Series, but got outplayed in every aspect. </p>
