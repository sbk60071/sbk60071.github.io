 <p> The 1986 World Series was the most recent that the Mets have won. They played the Boston
 Sox, who were just coming off of a close series against the California Angels. This series
 went 7 games, with a miraculous come back by the Mets after being down 3-2 in the series.
 Game 6 was the most notable game in this series, as the Mets mounted run support late in the
 game when their hopes looked very grim, thanks to a famous error by Bill Buckner of the 
 Red Sox. The Mets rode this momentum to then win game 7, in what was considered one of the 
 most topsy turvy World Series' ever. </p>
