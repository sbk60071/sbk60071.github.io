 <p> The 2000 World Series was rather disappointing in regards to other Mets apperances. They
 played the New York Yankees, in what was percieved to be a very even matchup. The series 
 started off with 2 very close Yankee wins, which led to another tight game in which the 
 Mets barely won late in the game. However, now down 2-1, the Mets crumbled as the Yankees
 took the next 2 games and thus the series. Losing 4 games to 1 is quite poor, despite the 
 games all being relatively tight. </p>
