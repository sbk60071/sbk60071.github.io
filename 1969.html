   <p> The 1969 World Series was the first of two that the Mets have won to date. The series
     lasted 5 games in which the Mets won 4 straight after dropping the first. With the odds,
	 stacked so heavily in the Orioles favor, it was a huge deal for the Mets to beat them in such 
	 a convincing manner. The series MVP was awarded to Donn Clendenon, as he had 3 home runs in
	 the five games, a record for 5-game world series' to date. </p>
